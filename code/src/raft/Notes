RAFT B

- add a separate message of abort to send to a channel when you change your leader status	(DONE)
- do you revert your leader status despite having a higher commit index?			(Yes)
- does a heartbeat feature some log entries? (L: 1 2 3 F: )					(No)

- RequestVoteRPC taking too long for disconnect servers. A third partition can't choose a leader! (Fixed)

- ConcurrentStarts2B test failing about half of the time. I suspect that is to do with the heartbeat mechanism for commiting
entries and with the AppendEntries logic for the server. Need to review and fix it.
- Add  eatures to make it easier to debug.
- Refine the code
